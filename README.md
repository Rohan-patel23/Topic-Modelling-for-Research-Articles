# Topic-Modelling-for-Research-Articles

Topic modeling is a well-established approach in natural language processing (NLP) that has been widely used to a range of text mining problems such as document classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying topic modeling to research publications in order to identify significant themes and sub-topics, comprehend the structure of research fields, and follow the growth of research through time.\par

We investigate the application of topic modeling to assess a huge corpus of research papers in a certain subject using cutting-edge NLP approaches in this research project. The purpose of this project is to build an effective way to discover and track major research themes and sub-topics, as well as to select the most relevant papers and authors for each topic.\par

To do this, we first gather a huge dataset of research papers in the target subject, which we then preprocess and analyze using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. The most relevant themes and sub-topics in the corpus are then identified using a number of topic modeling approaches such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).\par

Lastly, we compare the selected subjects and sub-topics to existing taxonomies and manually curated annotations to assess the success of our technique. We also examine how the chosen themes have evolved over time and identify the most prominent writers and articles for each topic.\par

The results of this study have potential applications in a variety of fields, including scientific research, industry, and policy formulation. We may assist academics, policymakers, and industry experts in better understanding the structure and growth of a certain study area by identifying the most essential subjects and sub-topics.\par
